# Face_Recognition_CNN

Implemented one-shot learning to solve a face recognition problem

Applied the triplet loss function to learn a network's parameters in the context of face recognition

Tried face recognition as a binary classification problem

Mapped face images into 128-dimensional encodings using a pretrained VGG19 model

Performed face verification and face recognition with these encodings

Implemented the Neural Style Transfer algorithm

Generateed novel artistic images using Neural Style Transfer

Defined the style cost function for Neural Style Transfer

Defined the content cost function for Neural Style Transfer

## The python code has been uploaded. Happy learning :)
